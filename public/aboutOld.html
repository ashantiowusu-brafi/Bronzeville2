            Chandra Christmas-Rouse is a 2020
            <a href="http://www.three-walls.org/">Threewalls</a> Artist Fellow
            and lives in Bronzeville. Her art project is a word game called
            Maplibs inspired by Madlibs. Maplibs is about the spaces that make
            our neighborhoods feel like a community. The goal of participation
            is to create a map of the memories, experiences and dreams of those
            spaces. You can play the word game here. You can also leave a
            voicemail or text your answers to 312-869-2584. If you are
            interested in learning more or creating the next edition of the word
            game about your block or school, you can reach her by email
            <a href="cchristmasrouse@gmail.com">here</a>.
